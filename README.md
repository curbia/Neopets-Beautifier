# Neopets-Beautifier
A collection of scripts and images to fix broken content on Neopets. All images are Â© Neopets.com, with minor fan edits under Fair Use.

## Avatars

Several of the avatars on Neopets notoriously have graphical issues, including unnecessary whitespace, blurry text, and asymmetrical borders. This project provides fan-edited versions that aim to unify the style of all avatars, optimising for clarity and compatibility will all background colours.

## Other images

Images from all over the site may be contributed. We prefer that images be submitted as PNG files, to allow for transparency and to prevent artifacts. As part of a larger project to bring a true dark mode to Neopets, removing unneccesary white backgrounds from images is promoted!
